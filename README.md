# 1. Overview

The Data Integration Building Blocks (DIBBs) project is an effort to help state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments better make sense of and utilize their data. You can read more about the project on the [main DIBBs repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi/blob/main/README.md).

This repository is specifically to develop an AWS "starter kit" for the DIBBs project. This will enable our jurisdictional partners to build from this repository to provision their own AWS infrastructure.

# 4. Getting Started
This section will assist engineers with executing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) found in the _dibbs-aws_ repository utilizing Terraform.  

+ [Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents).

## 4.1 Requirements
Engineers will need following tools installed on their local machine:
* Terraform version 1.0.0+  [_See_ Hashicorp installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
* AWS CLI version 2+ [_See_ AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* AWS Profile Access \
-- <u>Note</u>: Engineers *must* have access and permissions to create AWS resources

## 4.2 Clone DIBBS-AWS Repository

1. Create a directory to store the repository on your local machine
- Mac OS users: `mkdir workspace`
- Windows users: `md workspace`
2. Clone the dibbs-aws repository (<u>use one of the following commands</u>:)
- `git clone git@github.com:CDCgov/dibbs-cloud.git` 
- `git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-cloud.git`

## 4.3 Begin Using Repository
_4.3.1_ Navigate to the `dibbs-aws` repository on your local machine.\
&ensp; `cd /workspace/dibbs-aws`\
_4.2.2_ Make a new branch.\
&ensp; For example, `git checkout -b update–and-setup-dibbs-aws-backend`.\
_4.3.3_ Navigate to _terraform/implementation/ecs/var.tf_.\
&ensp; Update the _"owner"_ variable default value.  Save your changes.  Add and commit your changes.\
&ensp; `git add terraform/implementation/ecs/var.tf`\
&ensp; `git commit -m "update owner value to [insertValue]"`\
&ensp; `git push`

## 4.4 Begin Using Terraform

4.4.1 Navigate to terraform/implementation.\
&ensp; Initialize your local terraform code. `terraform init`\
4.4.2 Developing in a terraform workspace.\
&ensp; Check the terraform workspaces. `terraform workspace list`\
&ensp; _Note_: If you only have a default terraform workspace, you can create a terraform workspace to develop in.  _Skip to 5.3, below_.\
- Select the terraform workspace to develop in.\
 &ensp; `terraform workspace select {selectEnvironmentName}`\
 &ensp; For example, `terraform workspace select dev`.\
- Create a terraform workspace to develop in.\
&ensp; `terraform workspace new {newEnvironmentName}`.\
&ensp; For example, `terraform workspace new dev`.

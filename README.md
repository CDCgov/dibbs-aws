# 1. Overview

The Data Integration Building Blocks (DIBBs) project is an effort to help state, local, territorial, and tribal public health departments better make sense of and utilize their data. You can read more about the project on the [main DIBBs eCR Viewer repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-ecr-viewer/blob/main/README.md).

This repository is specifically to develop an AWS "starter kit" for the DIBBs project. This will enable our jurisdictional partners to build from this repository to provision their own AWS infrastructure. 

This repository is actively used by the DIBBs eCR Viewer team to deploy and test their application in AWS.

# 3. Architectural Design
The current architectural design for dibbs-aws is as follows:

![Current DIBBS Architecture as of 6-24-2024](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-aws/assets/29112142/7d43d3c1-5d61-41b8-a1c3-bb4884073825)

# 4. Getting Started
This section will assist engineers with executing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) found in the _dibbs-aws_ repository utilizing Terraform.  

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 4.1.0 Requirements
**Engineers will need following tools installed on their local machine:**
* Terraform version 1.0.0+  [Hashicorp installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
  * [Terraform Documentation](#411-terraform-documentation)
* AWS CLI version 2+ [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* AWS Profile Access

_**Note**_: Engineers *must* have access and permissions to create AWS resources

## 4.1.1 Terraform documentation
* If you havn't used terraform before, and have the will to learn, please visit these resources before continuing.
  - Terraform Documentation: The official Terraform documentation is an exhaustive resource that covers everything from installation to advanced topics. https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs
  - Terraform/AWS Intro: HashiCorp provides an official tutorial that covers the basics of Terraform and helps you get started with deploying infrastructure into AWS. https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started
  - Terraform AWS Provider Documentation: If you're using Terraform with AWS, this documentation provides detailed information on the available resources and data sources. https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs
  - Terraform module published by the dibbs-ecr-viewer DevOps teams this repo uses: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/CDCgov/dibbs-ecr-viewer/aws/latest

## 4.2 Helper Scripts

**If you are familiar with terraform, have setup a backend, understand terraform deployment workflows, know how to validate terraform, or are otherwise opinionated about how you want to run things, feel free to skip this section**
- We have several helper scripts that will assist you with setting up your AWS backend and deploying your AWS resources. 
- These scripts are located in the **terraform/utilities** folder, the **terraform/implementation/setup** folder and the **terraform/implementation/ecs** folder.
- The **utilities** folder contains scripts that will assist in generating terraform docs, formatting and linting terraform code.
- The **setup.sh** script will assist you with creating the terraform state and .env files to be used later, also sets up OIDC for your GitHub workflows. 
- The **deploy.sh** script will assist you with deploying your ECS module from your development machine.

_**Note**_: It is not recommended to run these scripts without reviewing them and understanding their limitations.

_**Note**_: It is not recommended to use these scripts to automate your terraform deployments, please see the [GitHub workflows](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-aws/tree/main/.github/workflows) for examples on how to do that.

**Terraform validation and docs with `./utils.sh`**
* In your terminal, navigate to the _/terraform/utilities_ folder.
* `cd /terraform/utilities`
* Run `./tfdocs.sh` to generate terraform documentation.
* Run `./tffmt.sh` to validate your terraform code.
* Run `./tflint.sh` to lint your terraform code.
* Run `./utils.sh` to run all utilities.

**Update And Setup Your AWS Backend with `./setup.sh`**
* In your terminal, navigate to the _/terraform/implementation/setup_ folder.
* `cd /terraform/implementation/setup`  
* Run `./setup.sh`

_**Note**_: You will be prompted to set your variable values (i.e. *Region*, *Owner*, *Project*, etc.).  For example, the default value for *Owner* is `Skylight`. You can change this value to one that represents your organization or department. Keep these short and sweet to prevent running into character limits when provisioning AWS resources. _The Owner name <u>must</u> be <u>less than</u> 13 characters_.

The `setup.sh` scripts will assist you with creating the terraform state and tfvars files, as well as check to ensure the necessary arguments or variables were created.  See [setup.sh](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-aws/blob/main/terraform/implementation/setup/setup.sh) file.  Also see [Inputs](https://github.com/CDCgov/dibbs-aws/blob/main/terraform/implementation/setup/README.md#inputs).

The setup.sh script will create the following files:

- _tfstate.tfvars_
- _.env_
- _terraform.state_

**Deploy Your ECS Module with `./deploy`**
* It is highly recommended to create a new directory per environment that is launched, to do so run `cp terraform/implementation/ecs terraform/implementation/<ENVIRONMENT>`.
  * The benefits of doing this reduces the likelyhood of conflicts and allows each environment to run different versions of the same module.
* To run your ECS Module Changes in your local terminal, navigate to your working directory, ` cd terraform/implementation/ecs/` or `cd terraform/implementation/<ENVIRONMENT>`
* In your terminal run the deploy script for your designated environment `./deploy.sh -e <ENVIRONMENT>`.

_**Note**_: The _-e_ tag stands for environment and you can specify `dev`, `test`, `prod`, this can match your `<ENVIRONMENT>` naming convention.
or whatever environment your team desires.
